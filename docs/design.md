# Design

Measure the displacement between a glider's first main-wheel touchdown and the
target line of a spot-landing competition, from one fixed camera that records
continuously; store each landing as a clip; let a judge confirm; show a ranking.

Decisions:

- **One AXIS P1485-LE**, side-on, 75 m from the strip, mast > 8 m. It films the
  **touchdown window only** (±19 m around the target line, ~1.5 s per landing).
  Landings outside the window are bounded (`< −19 m` / `> +19 m`), not measured.
- **Identification by OGN, confirmed by the judge.** No OCR: a 30 cm character
  is ~15 px at this distance.
- **Purpose: club training and competitions.** Target accuracy ~0.3 m; the
  automatic result and the judge's decision are stored side by side.

## 1. Architecture

Recorder and analysis are separate processes sharing a folder, so analysis can
never cost the recorder a frame. Everything downstream reads the raw segments,
so a day is re-processable offline.

### Stack

Python 3.12+, ffmpeg on `PATH`. Core dependency: NumPy. Optional: `ui`
(FastAPI, uvicorn), `analysis` (opencv-python-headless 4.x). `capture/`,
`clips/`, `identify/` and `store/` are stdlib-only so the recorder cannot fail
to import at the airfield. Results are JSON, not a database.

Packaging: PyInstaller + setup wizard on Windows (bundles ffmpeg); a `.deb` with
a venv under `/opt/pta` and a systemd service on Debian.

## 2. Camera and site

### 2.1 AXIS P1485-LE at 75 m

| | |
|---|---|
| Sensor | 1/2.8" CMOS, 1920 × 1080, 50/60 fps, rolling shutter |
| Lens | 10.8–28.2 mm varifocal, HFOV 29°–11° |
| Covered width at 10.8 mm | 38.8 m = ±19.4 m around the target line |
| Scale at the target line | 49.5 px/m (20 mm/px) |
| Travel per frame at 60 fps | 0.42 m at 25 m/s |
| Motion blur at 1/1000 s | 25 mm ≈ 1.2 px |

`python tools/site_geometry.py --distance 75 --mast 8` recomputes these.

### 2.2 The measurement window

±19.4 m (`WINDOW_HALF_M` in `pipeline.py`). A glider is in frame ~1.5 s
(~93 frames), enough for the fits, which need a few frames on each side of the
contact. Consequences: the clip is a fixed window, the tracker has no approach
phase to wait for, identification cannot come from the image.

Landings that touch down outside the window are reported as a bound
(`short` / `long`), a legitimate result in a spot-landing competition.

Wider window if ever needed: a second body (P1465-LE 3–9 mm at HFOV ≈ 40°,
28 mm/px, ±27 m); nothing downstream of the calibration changes.

### 2.3 Mast height: > 8 m

Height barely affects the longitudinal number but sets the cross-strip
resolution and what a vertical pixel error costs longitudinally:

| Mast | Elevation | Cross-strip | Longitudinal per 1 px vertical |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| 3 m | 2.3° | 0.52 m/px | 0.13 m |
| **> 8 m** | **> 6.1°** | **< 0.19 m/px** | **< 0.05 m** |
| 12 m | 9.1° | 0.13 m/px | 0.03 m |

Tilt down ~6°, ground line about two thirds down the image. Mount on the side
that never looks into a low sun (in Switzerland: looking north).

### 2.4 Camera configuration

`touchdown-analyzer probe` checks resolution, fps and GOP; the rest is set once
in the camera:

- 1080p, **60 fps** (60 Hz power line mode). WDR off, it caps the frame rate.
- Max shutter 1/1000 s, exposure zone on the strip.
- **Zipstream off**, no dynamic FPS or GOP. Fixed GOP 60, capped VBR 12–16 Mbit/s
  (~5–7 GB/h).
- Stabilisation, barrel correction, defog **off**. Focus and zoom locked,
  autofocus off; re-zooming means re-calibrating.
- Day mode forced, IR off. NTP time. Fixed IP, wired PoE.

Rolling shutter: the wheel occupies a narrow band of rows, so the timing bias
is milliseconds and largely cancels in the fits.

## 3. Feature 1 — landing segmentation and clips

### 3.1 Detection (`analysis/detect.py`)

MOG2 on a half-scale frame (history 120 frames, threshold 24, shadow flag off),
morphology, contours, blobs ≥ 600 px². Tracking is nearest-neighbour
association against a constant-velocity prediction (gate 220 px, 5 missed
frames), one `Track` per moving object; a glider rarely shares the window with
anything, so no Kalman/SORT.

A track is analysed if it has ≥ 12 frames, ≥ 4000 px² at its largest and spans
≥ 250 px. The tracker survives segment boundaries.

### 3.2 Outcomes (`analysis/pipeline.py`, `store/landings.py`)

No state machine; each finished track gets one outcome:

| Outcome | Meaning | Label |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `measured` | contact instant found in the window | `+1.3 m` |
| `short` | already rolling at frame entry | `< −19 m` |
| `long` | still airborne at frame exit | `> +19 m` |
| `unseen` | low and level throughout; judge picks the frame | `pick frame` |
| `on_ground` | rolling for the whole track (taxi, rollout) | `rolling` |
| `departure` | lifted off in view | `take-off` |
| `airborne` | flew through without touching | `fly-through` |

`kind` follows: landing / departure / pass. A "ground run" more than 15 m off
the strip axis (`PLAUSIBLE_LATERAL_M`) is reclassified as `airborne`. A
calibration residual above target is flagged on every landing.

### 3.3 Clips (`clips/cutter.py`)

Fixed window **−3 s / +5 s** around the contact (anchored on frame entry/exit
for bounds). Stream copy from the covering raw segments: fast, lossless, at
most a GOP (1 s) early. Frame-exact work always goes through the raw segments.

Name: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<REG>.mp4`, timestamp = touchdown; `UNKNOWN-<seq>`
until identified, renamed on confirmation (history keeps the old name).
Overlay: same stem, `_overlay.jpg`.

Retention: raw segments a couple of weeks (re-processing), clips and results
indefinitely. The disk guard stops recording below 20 GB free.

### 3.4 Identification (`identify/ogn.py`)

1. **OGN live positions** (`live.glidernet.org`), polled every 5 s during a
   session into `ogn_fixes.jsonl`. A landing matches the aircraft whose fix is
   within 90 s of the touchdown, within 1.5 km of the target line and below
   150 m AGL.
2. **OGN FlightBook** logbook (`flightbook.glidernet.org`, KTrax as fallback),
   fetched on demand for the day: registration, type, and the landing/take-off
   minute, which also settles landing versus aerotow departure.
3. **Judge.** Names or corrects the aircraft and enters the pilot; the pilot is
   suggested from the aircraft's previous landing.

`identified_by` records which. The airfield (ICAO, position, elevation, time
zone) is in `config/ogn.json`, looked up from the FlightBook.

---

## 4. Feature 2 — touchdown displacement

### 4.1 Calibration (`calibration/homography.py`)

Survey ≥ 4 markers with a tape (the UI asks for three pairs, one on each strip
edge); click them in a still; solve. World frame: origin on the target line at
the strip centre, x along the strip (positive beyond the line in landing
direction), y lateral (positive right, seen from behind).

Solved by normalised DLT least squares over all markers, no RANSAC: a misclick
shows as one large residual instead of being silently discarded. RMS residual
is the quality number, **target 0.10 m** (`TARGET_RESIDUAL_M`). Saved to
`config/calibration.json`; every landing carries a copy.

A plane homography is exact for the wheel contact point, which is *on* the
ground plane at contact. Anything above the ground maps too far from the camera
by `height / tan(elevation)` — metres per decimetre at mast elevations. Hence
everything hinges on finding the tyre, not the fuselage or the shadow.

No lens undistortion and no drift check: the lens is not wide-angle and the
camera sits on a fixed mast.

### 4.2 Contact instant (`analysis/contact.py`, `analysis/touchdown.py`)

Per frame, inside the tracked box at full resolution:

1. **Aircraft / shadow split** against MOG2's background image: a foreground
   pixel that is a darker copy of the background with the same chroma is shadow.
2. **Tyre**: black compact blobs along the belly of the aircraft mask (cut
   adaptively above the blackest pixel; rubber reads ~0.1 of the background,
   shadow ~0.4). The wheel column is a quadratic in time through them with
   outliers rejected; per frame the blob nearest that column is the tyre and its
   bottom edge the contact row, smoothed the same way, interpolated only where
   hidden. Clipped frames are neither fitted nor drawn.
3. **Shadow reach**: rows of dark under the tyre before sunlit ground begins.

Two independent cues, each a corner fit on a per-frame series at sub-frame
resolution (8 sub-steps):

- **Shadow reach.** Shrinks linearly with wheel height and stops changing at
  contact; the floor is free (it depends on the sun). Needs no calibration; the
  primary cue in sunshine. Needs ≥ 5 px change and 4 frames each side.
- **Apparent depth.** The contact pixel mapped through the homography as if on
  the ground: the across-strip coordinate `Y(t)` falls until contact, then
  follows the ground run. Fitted as a hinge with free slope on both legs (so a
  mediocre calibration does not break it); the airborne leg must drop ≥ 1 m and
  ≥ 4 ground-run RMS, and the hinge must beat a single line by 20 % RMS. A
  single-line trend steeper than 3 m/s of apparent depth reads as height
  changing.

Combination: within 4 frames the cues are reported together; up to 30 frames
apart they bracket the contact, the estimate is the middle and the spread the
uncertainty; further apart they contradict and the landing is flagged. Without
a shadow the depth cue alone decides, and the landing / take-off / level-pass
ambiguity goes to the judge (`unseen`) and the logbook.

`method` records `shadow`, `depth` or `none`; `fit` keeps both fits; `flags`
the caveats.

### 4.3 Metres

Contact pixel → homography → `(x, y)` in metres, signed for the direction of
travel (both landing directions, one calibration). Stored: longitudinal,
lateral, uncertainty, frame, sub-frame, speed, direction, image point, and the
per-frame track (`TrackPoint`) so the browser can redraw it. The overlay JPG
draws the target line, the contact and the measured distance on the contact
frame.

### 4.4 Error budget

P1485-LE, 75 m, 8 m mast, 60 fps, 0.10 m calibration:

| Source | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Timing, raw frame rate | 0.42 m (25 m/s ÷ 60 fps) |
| Timing after sub-frame fit | **0.08–0.15 m** |
| Contact row / column (2 px) | 0.04 m |
| Vertical mis-detection (1 px) → longitudinal | 0.05 m |
| Homography + survey | 0.05–0.15 m |
| Heat shimmer | 0.05–0.2 m on hot afternoons |

≈ 0.2 m RSS, dominated by timing; at 30 fps ≈ 0.4 m. Holds for a landing with a
real sink rate; a greaser has no sharp corner and the judge's scrubber decides
the last metres.

### 4.5 Validation

- Hand-mark the contact frame on the Frames page (`/api/annotations`); compare
  bias and σ per session.
- Markers every 5 m along the strip edge; check the mapping reproduces the
  spacing.
- Roll a wheel to a tape-measured point: static truth for the geometry alone.

### 4.6 What the first footage changed (13 Sept 2026, Bellechasse)

Ten clips from a low tripod, six-marker calibration, residual 2.25 m:

- The lowest silhouette pixel is the shadow, not the wheel → the aircraft/shadow
  split and the tyre tracking of §4.2.
- The ground run is not level in calibrated coordinates (2 m drift over the
  window) → free slopes on both hinge legs; landing and take-off then look
  alike to the depth cue, the shadow or the logbook settles it.
- With a high sun there is no lit gap between glider and shadow, only a shadow
  reach that settles at a non-zero floor → corner fit with free floor.
- A flat flare has no sharp corner: on HB-3213 the two cues were 21 frames
  apart, so the estimate is the middle and the spread (±6 m there) the
  uncertainty. With the tyre tracked as an object the result is −3.2 m, the
  frame a 3× zoom picks.
- Overcast: no shadow, and with this calibration "rolling" and "floating a
  hand's width up" are indistinguishable (HB-1827) → `unseen`, the judge picks
  the frame. A 0.10 m calibration and the 8 m mast are what let the depth cue
  carry an overcast afternoon alone.

---

## 5. Data model (`store/landings.py`)

One `landings.json` per session in `data/landings/<session>/`, written
atomically; the file is the archive. Per landing:

```
id, session, created_utc, kind, outcome, status        pending | confirmed | rejected
touchdown_utc, segment, frame, subframe, fps, direction
longitudinal_m, lateral_m, uncertainty_m, bound_m, speed_mps, image_x/y
method, fit, flags, calibration, track[], first_utc, last_utc
registration, competition_number, aircraft_type, identified_by, ogn, pilot
clip_path, overlay_path
confirmed_utc, confirmed_longitudinal_m, confirmed_frame, note, history[]
```

The estimator's number and the judge's number are separate fields;
`scored_longitudinal_m` prefers the confirmed one. `history` records every
change with a timestamp.

Session directory (`data/raw/<session>/`): 10 s segments, `session.json`,
`segments.jsonl`, `gaps.jsonl`, `recorder.log`, `ogn_fixes.jsonl`,
`ogn_logbook.json`. Config: `config/calibration.json`, `scoring.json`,
`ogn.json`; camera URL in `.env` (git-ignored, carries the password).

Scoring (`store/scoring.py`): max points on the line, a deduction per metre
short and per metre long, a floor, out-of-range points, decimals; edited on the
Scoring page. Only `measured`, `short` and `long` are scored.

---

## 6. Control UI (`control/`)

FastAPI on localhost:8080 (`--host 0.0.0.0` for the field WiFi, no login).

| Page | Does |
|------|------|
| Capture (`/`) | probe, start/stop recording, live preview, disk and fps status |
| Calibration | grab a still, click markers, solve, residual |
| Frames (`/viewer`) | step a segment frame by frame, hand-mark a touchdown |
| Landings | every event with offset, overlay, scrubber, magnifier, OGN proposal, pilot; *Confirm / Reject / Use this frame*; analyse a session or follow the recording |
| Scoring | the rules and the scale drawn out |
| Board (`/board`) | read-only ranking for a big screen: per pilot the confirmed landings, offsets, points, total; unverified beside; refresh 5 s |

Confirming renames the clip and overlay; any change to what the board shows
rewrites `ranking.xlsx` / `ranking.pdf` in the session directory. The launcher
(tkinter) starts the server and shows the services and the log.
