"""ffmpeg clip cutting and clip naming. Stdlib only.

The clip is a fixed window around the touchdown, default -3 s / +5 s. The
pre-roll comes from the continuous recording, so it exists even though the
aircraft was only detected as it was about to land.

Cuts are stream copies: fast, lossless, and with a GOP of 60 at most a
second early at the start, which is fine for a clip whose job is to be
watched. Frame-exact work goes through the raw segments, never the clip.
