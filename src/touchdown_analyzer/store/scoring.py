"""The points a landing earns from its offset. Stdlib only.

The rules are the club's, not the software's: the full score on the target
line, a deduction per metre short and a different one per metre long (a
short landing is usually punished harder), a floor, and what a landing
outside the measurement window gets. They live in ``config/scoring.json``
and are edited from the Scoring page.
