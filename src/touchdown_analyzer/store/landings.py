"""The landing record and its per-session store (docs/design.md 5).

A session's results live in one ``landings.json`` next to its clips and
overlays. JSON rather than SQLite: a flying day is a few dozen landings, the
file is readable by anyone who opens it, and it round-trips through git-free
backups without tooling. Every write replaces the file atomically.

The automatic result and the judge's decision are kept apart on purpose:
``longitudinal_m`` is what the estimator found, ``confirmed_*`` is what was
signed off, and ``history`` records each change with a timestamp, so the
number that was scored can always be traced back to the number that was
measured.
