.SYNOPSIS
  Build the Windows installer: dist\PTA-Setup-<version>.exe

.DESCRIPTION
  Run from the repository root, inside the project's virtual environment
  (the one with the [ui,analysis] extras and pyinstaller installed):

      pip install -e ".[ui,analysis]" pyinstaller
      .\packaging\windows\build.ps1

  Steps: ffmpeg -> icon -> PyInstaller application folder -> zip ->
  PyInstaller setup program with the zip inside. ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe
  are downloaded once into vendor\ffmpeg\ (fetch_ffmpeg.py: gyan.dev
  "essentials" release, checksum verified) and installed as tools\ next to
  the program, so nothing needs to be on PATH at the airfield. -NoFfmpeg
  skips that; the installed program then looks for ffmpeg on PATH and the
  control window says so if it is missing.

.PARAMETER NoFfmpeg
  Do not download or bundle ffmpeg.

# otherwise turn into a terminating error; exit codes are checked instead.
